## Introduction: Sabine and the Wizard of Oz

Welcome! My final project is a Wizard of Oz inspired visual novel developed using the Ren'Py visual novel engine

It's a brief interactive story where the user explores the symbolism behind the Wizard of Oz movie/book.

## Ren'Py functionalities ##

My original plan was to run this visual novel on a website, but since HTML support for renpy is still in beta (it runs slowly) I developed the game locally. It can be played through the Ren'Py Launcher. 

This change in my original plan allowed me to focus more on exploring the language and applying many of its features into my visual novel.

Since Ren'Py is python3 based, my project features python concepts reviewed in class, including list and dictionaries; string and boolean and variables; for loops; if and else statements and operators. 

I also learned many of the Ren'Py functionalities such as:

    - Creating **screens**
    - Jumping through **labels**
    - Make interactive **buttons**
    - Make animated **transformations** 
    - Customize the **GUI** to show personalized dialogue boxes
    - Create personalized **Menus** that respond to specific choices made by the user
    - And many more...

I would suggest to explore the *script.rpy* file and all of the screens I created: 

    - counter_screen.rpy : Displays a Point Counter on the screen 
    - emerald_button.rpy : Interactive button
    - inventory_button.rpy : Displays a button that shows the Inventory
    - inventory_screen.rpy : Inventory system that displays items as images in a grid. A description appears when images are clicked. 
    - points_screen.rpy : Screen that notifies the user when they have gained a point. 

## How to run novel ##

To run the visual novel locally:

1. Run the Ren'Py launcher 
2. Change the Projects Directory to a location where the *final_project_wizard_of_oz* folder is located.
3. Return to main window and the project should appear in the "Projects" menu. 
4. Select project and click on "Launch Project".

Enjoy!
